	<h1>Rubik's Cubes Are Awesome</h1>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
		The cube consists of 6 sides, and each side has different<br>
		colors. Each side is able to rotate, which allows you to mix it up.<br>
		Thus, the cube turns into a puzzle once completely mixed up.<br>
		If you don't know, a Rubik's Cube looks like this:<br>

		There are two separate ways to solve a cube that I will go over<br>
		here, but there are many, many more:<br>

		We will we talking about the CFOP and Roux method
	<h2>CFOP Method</h2>
		This method is considered by most people
		as the best method. The current world record
		is held by a man who used this method,
		and almost every other person below him is using
		the same thing.
		
		This method consists of 3-4 steps:
		<ol>
			<li>Cross: you create a white cross, but make sure
			the colors on the side of the white's line up
			with the center colors too.</li>
			<li>F2L: You build on the corners and go
			until the bottom two layers are completed.</li>
			<li>OLL: Make the yellow top be compltely white
			(it might not be solved yet, and that's okay)</li>
			<li>PLL: Finish the cube! (The pros combine step 3 and 4)</li>
		</ol>
		
		Once you have completed all of these steps, you're done!
		The best of the best can complete this in less than 5 seconds.
		How fast can you do it?<br>

	<h2>Roux Method</h2>
		This method is good, but not nearly as good as CFOP.
		If you want to actually solve a Rubik's Cube,
		learn the CFOP Method first. This is more for fun
		once you've already learned how to solve the cube well.
		Here's how it goes:
		<ol>
			<li>First Block: You solve the left side, but only
			the middle, left, and right sides of it. If it sounds
			confusing, just look at the picture.</li>
			<li>Second Block: You do the same thing as before, but on the other side. Make sure to not solve the middle slice.
			That's for later.</li>
			<li>CMLL: This's where you're making sure the top
			corners are alighed correctly. It's hard to explain,
			but the video provided will explain what it should 
			look like when finished if interested.</li>
			<li>Move the Middle: This's the easy part.
			You move the top layer and the middle, making
			sure to align the white and yellow. And, done!
			Everything should be finished.</li>
		</ol>

	<h2>World Records</h2>
		Here is a table with the person who broke the record,
		the time they got, and what method they used. I'll just show the
		top ten.
		These are average time solves, not single solves. Average solves
		are more important at this high of level.
