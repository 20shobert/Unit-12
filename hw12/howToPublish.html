	<h1>How To Publish Onto Icarus</h1>
    <h6>(I'm using a Chromebook, so this will be a tutorial for how to publish using a Chromebook)</h6>
    
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>
        The very first thing you're going to do is ensure you have Linux Developmental Environment (LDE) turned on.
        <br>
        A Chromebook can't do very much without LDE turned on, so let's go ahead and turn it on now.
        <br>
        If it's already turned on, skip to step 2.
        <br>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open up the settings</li>
        <li>Under advanced settings, click on Developers, then Linux developmental environment</li>
        <li>Select 'Turn On'</li>
        <li>Follow the prompts, then move onto Step 2 once completed</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open up the terminal</li>
        <li>Under SSH, click 'Add SSH'</li>
        <li>Now, you'll have to know your username to login.<br>
            It starts with your initials (for me that's sh)<br>
            Then, you'll need the last five numbers of your W#<br>
            So, the entire username should be [initials][last 5].<br>
            For me, that will be sh48653.</li>
        <li>Once you have your username, type that into the 'Command' field<br>
            Follow your username by '@icarus.cs.weber.edu'<br>
            So, the field should look like '[username]@icarus.cs.weber.edu'<br>
            For me, it will look like 'sh48653@icarus.cs.weber.edu'</li>
        <li>Once completed, click 'Save'<br>
            <img src="images/sshDonePic_opt.jpeg" alt="Picture of SSH window with Done button circled" width="683" height="356"></li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>After you click save, you should have the address listed under SSH.<br>
            On the right side of the new address for Icarus, there should be three dots, signaling Options. Click that.<br>
            'Mount to Files' should come up. Click that too.</li>
        <li>Clicking will connect you to Icarus, and it should ask for a password<br>
            If you've logged into icarus before, you should know what to type here. Skip to step 5.<br>
            If not, follow to step 4.<br>
            <img src="images/icarusWantPassPic_opt.jpeg" alt="Picture of Icarus wanting a password" width="683" height="356"></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You will need quite a bit of information for your password. Sorry. Not my fault.<br>
            You will need:<br>
            Your initials (first, last), lowercase.<br>
            First 5 digits of your w#.<br>
            Lowest numbered CS/NET/WEB class being taken this current semester.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Example ( W + initials + ~ + w# + soc + class number)<br>
            initials: fl<br>
            W#: 12345<br>
            Lowest class: CS 1030</li>
        <li>Temp password:  Wfl~12345soc1030</li>
        <li>Once you get this information, type this into the password field, and click enter.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Once you have your password typed in, click done.<br>
            A box saying, 'Mounted!' should appear.<br>
            From this point on, don't close the window with Icarus on it! Otherwise, you won't be able to upload your files.<br>
            Your computer is now ready to upload files to Icarus!</li>
        <li>Open up your file exporer.<br>
            On the left side, there should be a new folder. This folder is where you will upload your files to Icarus.<br>
            <img src="images/fileUploadPic_opt.jpeg" alt="Picture of icarus on the left side of file explorer" width="683" height="356"></li>
        <li>Just drag and drop your files into the folder, and boom! It should upload.<br>
            You're done uploading the files!</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Step 6</h2>
    You should be done! The only thing you have to worry about now is how to access the website.
    <ol>
        <li>Put your html file in the public_html folder. The name doesn't matter.<br>
            In this example, the file name is wise.png.<br>
            <img src="images/wiseFilePic_opt.jpeg" alt="Picture of html file called wise.html in file explorer" width="683" height="356"><br>
            In order to access it on the website, in your web browser, type 'https://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~[username]/[fileName].html'<br>
            This will take you to the website:<br>
            <img src="images/wiseWebsitePic.png" alt="Picture of wise.html webiste">
        </li>
        <li>If you want to put the file in another folder, here's how you would go about it:<br>
            Ensure the folder is in public_html<br>
            <img src="images/testFilePic_opt.jpeg" alt="Picture of test.html in a Test folder in file explorer" width="683" height="356"><br>
            In order to access this file, in your web browser, type 'https://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~[username]/[folderName]/[fileName].html'<br>
            This will take you to the website:<br>
            <img src="images/testWebsitePic.png" alt="Picture of test.html website"></li>
        <li>If you don't want the user to have to type in the file name, here's how you do that:<br>
            This time, the file name does matter. Name the file 'index.html'.<br>
            <img src="images/indexFilePic_opt.jpeg" alt="Picture of index.html in file explorer" width="683" height="356"><br>
            The website link should look something like this: 'https://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~[username]'<br>
            This will take you to the website:<br>
            <img src="images/indexWebsitePic.png" alt="Picture of index.html website"></li>

    </ol>
